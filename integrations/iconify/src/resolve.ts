 * Resolves every planned ref into its icon literal and assembles the flat icons

 * keyed by the entry's alias. Misses (a resolver returning `null`) are collected
 * across the whole map and thrown once, listing every failing `alias → ref` —
 * the same all-at-once ethos as the schema's issue list, so a config with
 * several bad refs surfaces them together, not one per run.
 *
 * @param entries - The planned refs.
 * @param resolvers - Scheme-keyed resolvers (`iconify`, `url`, and overrides).
