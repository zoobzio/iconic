 * never has to change — only the `<symbol>` body behind it. That is what
 * `symbols` exists for: the partial batch an integration patches into the DOM in
 * place after `apply` / `update`.
 *
 * Rendering is cheap — `iconToSVG` plus symbol-string assembly measures about
 * 1.6µs per icon (a 2000-icon sheet ≈ 3.3ms), so there is no caching layer here.
