/**
 * The apply merge: a set resolved against a baseline contract into a fresh

 * that document — while `icons` is the baseline's map spread with the set's
 * overrides, so aliases the set does not rebind fall through to the baseline.
 * The set's icons and `tags` are detached through {@link copy}, so the merged
 * contract shares no mutable state with the set it was built from.
 *
 * The return type is left to inference: the spread carries a complete
 * contract-shaped document, which `apply` stores as the active state.
