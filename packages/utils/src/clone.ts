/**
 * Deep copy of a contract, facet by facet: identity is rebuilt field by field
 * (including a fresh `tags` array), and the `icons` map is rebuilt through
 * {@link copy}, so no definition object or metadata array is shared with the
 * source. Mutating the clone at any depth never reaches the original — the
 * runtime holds a clone as its construction-time baseline, detached from the
 * config it was seeded from.
 *
 * Optional identity fields are copied only when present, so the rebuild stays
 * key-for-key equal to the source; that equality proof also narrows the result
 * back to the source type without a cast. Cloning a reactive proxy this way
 * yields an inert, plain snapshot.
